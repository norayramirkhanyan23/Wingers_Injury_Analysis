##  Overview
This project examines whether early career workload (defined as matches before age 22) affects long-term durability and injury risk among elite 21st-century wingers.  
Data was **manually collected from Transfermarkt** and includes metrics such as matches, injuries, missed days, and positions.  
The visuals illustrate key trends in player health and workload balance.

## 📊 Visuals
- **Match Distribution:** Before vs After age 22  
- **Injury Growth:** Injury increase with age  
- **Workload vs Durability:** Matches vs missed days (RW/LW comparison)  
- **Correlation Matrix:** Relationship between workload and injuries  
- **Best of the Best:** Messi vs Ronaldo radar comparison  
- **Lamine Yamal Projection:** Predicting future durability

## 🧩 Key Insights
- Wingers show **4–5× higher injury growth** after 22.  
- **Strong correlation (≈0.87)** between missed days and post-22 injuries.
